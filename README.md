# ENCODERGRAPH
Plots rotary optical encoder masks on transparencies to make homemade optical encoders.

Currently, the user has to set the parameters in the code; these are:

r = 1# radius in inches

size = 5# figure size in inches

N = 64# Number of encoder lines

res = 72# Resolution in number of dots per inch
